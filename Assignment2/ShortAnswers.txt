Q1:
Intelligence gathering: Language misidentification might result in wrongly
identifying the enemy, which can unnecessarily increase tensions between the
two nations. Worse still, a war can break out and innocent lives will be taken.

Q2: To improve our algorithm performance, we have to improve the data input.
Plan 1: Hires linguistic specialists to provide credible texts of different languages.
Plan 2: Calls for community to provide and label data and has a team of supervisors to validate the quality.

Q3: Advantage of:
Plan 1: High-quality assurance.
Plan 2: Low cost compares to plan 1 and abundant amount of data.

Q4:
Plan 2.
The abundant amount of data from the contributors is a huge benefit for the algorithm.
The policy, however, has to have a mechanism to assure the quality source. For example,
the contributors can enter their GPS as a mechanism to validate that they are indigenous
people or at least they are living in the location where the language comes from, or the
contributors can cross-check each other sources.

Q5:
Strength: High accuracy for text scripts that has a huge amount of data as input to build the algorithm.
Weakness: Low accuracy for short texts, texts that have been transliterated, scripts that have small data
          or no data at all as input to build the algorithm, etc.
When releasing the tool, we can,  for scripts that the algorithm is not certain or has little or no
knowledge about,  handle the problem in some ways:
- Output the top possible language for small texts for the users to self-evaluation.
- For scripts that the algorithm has little or no knowledge about (the cosine similarity is under a threshold,
  for example), the programmer has the responsibility to announce this problem to the user.
