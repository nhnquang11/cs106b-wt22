Q1:
If criteria like minimizing wrongful denials were not included in the contract, engineers should have
included them in their optimization algorithm under one condition. Engineers should have reconsidered
the contract with the customer to clear things out.

Q2:
accessibility, ease of use, intuitive, efficiency, support policy

Some metrics to assess the model: fraudulent percentage, customer satisfaction
(through rating and review system), the efficiency of the algorithm (e.g. latency),
and eligibility acceptance rate through the years.
