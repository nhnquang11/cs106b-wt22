Put your answers to the debugging questions from Problem One in this file.

Q1:
finish = 'C'
numDisks = 5
start = 'A'
temp = 'B'

Q2:
Function: makeTheMagicHappen()
File: TowersOfHanoiGUI.cpp

Q3:
31 moves

Q4:
totalMoves = 15

Q5:
Inputs that have two characters.

Q6:
Character "=".

Q7:
The extra character "=" in the line "Set<string> thisOption = permutationsRec(remaining, chosen += ch);"
changes the variable chosen passed into the function permutationsRec in the next loop. This causes a bug 
when there is more than one loop, which is equivalent to the inputs having at least two characters.
